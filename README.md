# sector-shaped-cable-impedance-data
This repository contains the calculated series impedance data for a set of Low Voltage sector-shaped underground cables, the impedance data are generated using different analytical formulations and through a finite element computation


Part of a the paper Impact of LV Cable Impedance Model Fidelity on Distribution System State Estimation
